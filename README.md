# Poker-Tracking-Template
Poker players often keep poor track of their results. This is a set of instructions in R to help create a database for poker results and then use that data to better understand their successes and failures as a player through analysis and visualization. These guidelines/templates are written with code from Hadley Wickham's tidyverse package. The files are R markdowns to help guide the reader.
